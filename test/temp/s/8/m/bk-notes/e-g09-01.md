## Full Summary

This chapter introduces us to Margie and Tommy, two children living in the future, specifically in the year 2157. Their world is vastly different from ours. They don't have traditional schools or printed books. Instead, they learn from mechanical teachers (computers) at home, and their books are telebooks (digital books on screens).

One day, Tommy finds an old, physical book in his attic. This book is a relic from the past, a time when schools were different. Margie and Tommy are fascinated by it. They find it strange that the words on the pages don't move and that the book is made of paper.

Margie has been struggling with her geography lessons from her mechanical teacher. She's been doing poorly, and her mother calls the County Inspector to check the machine. The Inspector, a friendly man, finds that the geography sector of the mechanical teacher was set too fast for her age. He adjusts it, and Margie's performance improves.

Margie and Tommy discuss the old schools from the book. They learn that children used to go to a special building called a school, where human teachers taught them. They find this concept very different from their own experience of learning at home from a mechanical teacher.

Margie starts to think about how much fun the old schools must have been. She imagines children playing and learning together, helping each other with homework. She feels a sense of loneliness and isolation in her own learning environment. The story ends with Margie reflecting on the "fun they had" in the old days, contrasting it with her own solitary learning experience. The story explores the themes of technological advancement, the potential loss of human interaction, and the importance of community in learning.
