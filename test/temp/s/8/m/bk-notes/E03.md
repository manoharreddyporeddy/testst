### **Summary of "The Little Girl"**

- **Introduction to Kezia and Her Father:**

  - Kezia, a little girl, initially **fears her father**, viewing him as a **figure to be avoided**.
  - Every morning, her father gives her a **casual kiss** before leaving for work, to which she responds with a timid **"goodbye, Father"**.
  - She feels a **glad sense of relief** when she hears his carriage fading away, indicating her fear of him.
  - In the evening, Kezia hears her father’s **loud voice** demanding tea, his paper, and slippers, which intimidates her further.

- **Kezia’s Interaction with Her Father:**

  - Kezia’s mother instructs her to take off her father’s boots, but Kezia is **terrified** by his stern demeanor and the way he looks at her over his spectacles.
  - Her father asks if she’s been a **good girl**, but Kezia stutters in response, **"I d-d-don’t know, Father"**, because she is nervous around him (though she doesn’t stutter with others).
  - Her father scolds her for stuttering, saying her mother might need to take her to a doctor, and remarks that she looks **wretched** and **on the brink of suicide**, which adds to her fear.
  - Kezia finds her father physically intimidating—his **big hands**, **neck**, and **yawning mouth** make her think of him as a **giant**.

- **Sundays with Her Parents:**

  - On Sundays, Kezia’s grandmother encourages her to have a **"nice talk"** with her parents in the drawing-room.
  - However, Kezia finds her mother reading and her father **sleeping on the sofa**, snoring with a handkerchief over his face and his feet on a cushion.
  - When her father wakes up, he tells Kezia not to **stare** at him, saying she looks like a **"little brown owl"**, which makes her feel awkward.

- **Kezia’s Gift for Her Father:**

  - One day, while Kezia is indoors with a cold, her grandmother suggests she make a **pin-cushion** for her father’s upcoming birthday using yellow silk.
  - Kezia stitches three sides of the pin-cushion but needs something to fill it with.
  - She wanders into her mother’s bedroom, finds **sheets of fine paper** on the bed-table, tears them into pieces, stuffs the pin-cushion, and sews it shut.

- **The Incident with the Papers:**

  - That night, there is a **hue and cry** in the house because the papers Kezia used were her father’s **important speech for the Port Authority**.
  - Kezia’s mother questions her, and Kezia admits she tore the papers for her **"surprise"**.
  - Her father is furious, and Kezia is dragged to the dining room where he demands to see the pin-cushion.
  - Despite Kezia’s explanation that it was for his birthday, her father **beats her** with a ruler on her **pink palms** as punishment for touching things that don’t belong to her.
  - Kezia, crying, is comforted by her grandmother, who wraps her in a shawl and rocks her, but Kezia questions, **"What did God make fathers for?"**
  - The incident leaves a lasting impact—Kezia hides her hands behind her back the next time she sees her father, her cheeks turning red with fear.

- **Kezia’s Observation of the Macdonalds:**

  - Kezia observes the **Macdonald family** next door, who have five children.
  - She sees Mr. Macdonald playing **tag** with his children, carrying his baby Mao on his shoulders, laughing, and even letting the boys spray him with a hose—a stark contrast to her father’s sternness.
  - This leads Kezia to realize there are **"different sorts of fathers"**, as Mr. Macdonald is loving and playful.

- **A Change in Kezia’s Perception:**
  - When Kezia’s mother falls ill and goes to the hospital with her grandmother, Kezia is left alone with **Alice**, the cook.
  - At night, Kezia is scared of being alone and fears having a **nightmare** about a **butcher with a knife and rope**, a recurring dream.
  - Despite Alice’s reassurance, Kezia has the nightmare and wakes up crying for her grandmother.
  - Her father comes to her room with a candle, and upon hearing about her nightmare, he takes her to his bed, tucks her in, and lies beside her to comfort her.
  - Kezia snuggles close to him, feeling safe, and rubs her feet against his legs to warm them as he suggests.
  - As her father falls asleep, Kezia feels a **"funny feeling"** of understanding—she realizes her father isn’t as **big** or intimidating as she thought, and he works hard every day, leaving him too tired to be playful like Mr. Macdonald.
  - Kezia feels sympathy for her father, noting his **"big heart"** as she hears it beating while resting her head on his chest.
