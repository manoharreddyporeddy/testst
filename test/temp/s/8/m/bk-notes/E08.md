#### Travelogue: Kathmandu by Vikram Seth

The travelogue, an extract from Seth's book "Heaven Lake," begins with a personal account of his journey, setting the stage for his experiences in Kathmandu. The "BEFORE You READ" section engages readers by asking about their travel preferences and familiarity with holy places like Ajmer Sharif and Varanasi, prompting reflection on the surroundings of sacred sites in their own cities.

- **Arrival and Accommodation:**

  - Seth arrives in Kathmandu and secures a cheap room in the town center, resting for hours to recover from his journey.

- **Temple Visits:**

  - Accompanied by Mr. Shah's son and nephew, he visits two significant temples: Pashupatinath, sacred to Hindus, and Baudhnath Stupa, a Buddhist shrine.
  - **Pashupatinath Temple:**
    - Features a sign proclaiming "Entrance for Hindus only," reflecting restricted access.
    - The atmosphere is described as "febrile confusion," with priests, hawkers, devotees, tourists, cows, monkeys, pigeons, and dogs roaming the grounds.
    - Observations include a crowded scene where worshippers elbow each other to get the priest's attention, a princess of the Nepalese royal house appearing and receiving bows, and saffron-clad Westerners struggling for entry, with a policeman unconvinced of their Hindu identity.
    - A notable incident involves a fight between two monkeys, one chasing the other onto a shivalinga, running to the holy Bagmati river.
    - By the river, a corpse is cremated, washerwomen work, and children bathe, with a basket of wilted flowers dropped from a balcony. A small shrine on the riverbank, when fully emerged, is believed to release the goddess, ending the evil period of Kaliyug.
  - **Baudhnath Stupa:**
    - In contrast, it offers a sense of stillness, with an immense white dome ringed by a road and small shops owned by Tibetan immigrants selling felt bags, Tibetan prints, and silver jewelry.
    - The absence of crowds makes it a haven of quietness amidst the busy streets.

- **City Impressions:**

  - Kathmandu is depicted as vivid, mercernary, and religious, with small shrines to flower-adorned deities lining the narrowest and busiest streets.
  - The streets are bustling with fruit sellers, flute sellers, hawkers of postcards, and shops selling Western cosmetics, film rolls, chocolate, copper utensils, and Nepalese antiques.
  - The soundscape includes film songs blaring from radios, car horns, bicycle bells, stray cows lowing, and vendors shouting, creating a lively yet chaotic environment.

- **Personal Indulgences:**

  - Seth indulges mindlessly, purchasing a bar of marzipan, a corn-on-the-cob roasted in a charcoal brazier (rubbed with salt, chili powder, and lemon), love story comics, and a Reader's Digest, washing it down with Coca Cola and a nauseating orange drink, feeling better afterward.

- **Travel Plans and Decision:**

  - Considering his route home, he contemplates a scenic journey by bus and train to Patna, then sailing up the Ganges past Benaras to Allahabad, and up the Yamuna past Agra to Delhi, driven by enthusiasm for travel. However, feeling exhausted and homesick on the last day of August, he opts for a direct flight, booking a ticket with Nepal Airlines for the next day.

- **Flute Seller Encounter:**
  - Near his hotel, he observes a flute seller with a pole from which fifty or sixty bansuris (flutes) protrude like porcupine quills, made of bamboo, including cross-flutes and recorders.
  - The seller plays slowly and meditatively, without excessive display, not shouting his wares, and making sales in an offhanded manner, occasionally chatting with a fruit seller.
  - Seth finds it difficult to leave the square, captivated by the flute music, which he describes as both universal and particular, noting flutes like the reed neh, recorder, Japanese shakuhachi, deep bansuri of Hindustani classical music, and South American and Chinese flutes, each with specific fingering and compass.
  - He reflects that flute music, powered by living breath and needing pauses like human speech, draws him into the commonality of mankind, surprising himself with its significance, unlike previous returns home after long absences abroad.

This detailed account highlights Seth's observational skills and emotional responses, offering a rich tapestry of cultural and personal insights.

#### Poem: A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal by Wordsworth

This poem, part of the chapter, explores the poet's reaction to the death of a loved one, focusing on acceptance and the integration with nature.

- **Theme and Tone:**

  - The poem reflects on death with a sense of peace rather than bitter grief, as indicated by the opening line, "A slumber did my spirit sealâ€”I had no human fears."

- **Description of the Loved One:**

  - Before death, she seemed timeless, unaffected by the passage of time, as seen in "She seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years."

- **Post-Death Imagery:**
  - After death, she is devoid of motion and force, unable to hear or see, becoming part of the natural world, as described in "No motion has she now, no force; / She neither hears nor sees; / Rolled round in earth's diurnal course / With rocks and stones and trees."
  - This imagery suggests she is now part of the earth's daily rotation, merged with nature rather than existing in a heavenly state.

The poem's brevity is compensated by its depth, inviting readers to ponder mortality and the natural cycle.

#### Poem: Fear No More by Shakespeare

The final part, "Fear No More," is a consolatory poem emphasizing the inevitability and equality of death, freeing one from earthly troubles.

- **Structure and Content:**

  - Comprising three stanzas, each beginning with "Fear no more," it lists various fears one is relieved from upon death.

- **First Stanza:**

  - Advises not to fear the heat of the sun or winter's rages, noting that worldly tasks are done, and one has gone home, taken wages.
  - Highlights universality with "Golden lads and girls all must, / As chimney-sweepers, come to dust," equating the rich and poor in death.

- **Second Stanza:**

  - No fear of the frown of the great or the tyrant's stroke, no need to care for clothing or food, as "To thee the reed is as the oak."
  - Emphasizes that all symbols of power (scepter), knowledge (learning), and medicine (physic) must follow and come to dust.

- **Third Stanza:**

  - No fear of lightning-flash, thunder-stone, slander, or rash censure, as one has finished joy and moan.
  - Concludes with "All lovers young, all lovers must / Consign to thee, and come to dust," reinforcing that all, especially lovers, must die.

- **Interpretation:**
  - The poem, as noted by Theresa Kane, is exhilarating with stormy words yet offers a quiet, peaceful resolution in the last two lines of each verse, presenting death as a hard, proud, and fierce inevitability, akin to a rock in a storm.

This poem, part of the "Read and Enjoy" section, complements the chapter's exploration of death with a stoic, egalitarian perspective.
