### 2. Summary in Bullet Points

Here is a detailed summary of the chapter with important words bolded:

- **Overview**:
  - **Democracy** isn’t just about electing rulers; it involves **institutions** like **legislature**, **executive**, and **judiciary** working together.
  - This chapter explores how **major decisions** are made, implemented, and disputes resolved in India’s **Central Government**.
  - It asks: What do these **institutions** do? How are they connected? How **democratic** are they?

- **Section 4.1 - How is a Major Policy Decision Taken?**:
  - Example: On 13 August 1990, an **Office Memorandum** (O.M. No. 36012/31/90) reserved 27% of government jobs for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC).
  - The **Mandal Commission** (1979) recommended this; **Parliament** debated it for years; Janata Dal promised it in 1989 elections, and **Prime Minister V.P. Singh** implemented it in 1990.
  - Process: **President** announced intent, **Cabinet** decided, **government officials** drafted the order, and a Joint Secretary signed it.
  - Protests erupted: some supported **reservations** for fairness, others opposed it for denying equal opportunity.
  - **Supreme Court** resolved the **dispute** in 1992 (Indira Sawhney case), upheld the order but excluded well-off SEBCs (modified in 1993).
  - **Institutions** ensure decisions are made, executed, and checked; they involve rules but prevent rushed, bad choices.

- **Section 4.2 - Parliament**:
  - **Parliament** (Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, and **President**) is the supreme **legislature**, making **laws**, controlling **government**, approving budgets, and debating issues.
  - Lok Sabha (directly elected, 543 members, 5-year term) is more powerful than Rajya Sabha (indirectly elected, 250 members, permanent with 1/3 retiring every 2 years).
  - Lok Sabha prevails in joint sessions, controls money bills (Rajya Sabha delays 14 days), and can remove the **Council of Ministers** via no-confidence.
  - Example: **Parliament** influenced the **Mandal decision** through debates, showing its role in shaping **policy**.

- **Section 4.3 - Political Executive**:
  - **Executive** executes **policies**: **Political Executive** (elected, e.g., **Prime Minister**, **ministers**) decides, while **Permanent Executive** (civil servants) implements.
  - **Prime Minister**, appointed by **President** from Lok Sabha majority, leads the **Cabinet** (25 top **ministers**), coordinates ministries, and can dismiss **ministers**.
  - **Council of Ministers** (60-80) includes Cabinet, Ministers of State (independent or assisting); decisions are collective, binding all.
  - **Political Executive** has more power than civil servants because they’re elected, accountable to people, and set **policy** goals despite less expertise.
  - **President**, elected by MPs and MLAs, is nominal head; signs **laws**, appoints officials (e.g., **Prime Minister**) on **Cabinet** advice, but has discretion if no majority.

- **Section 4.4 - The Judiciary**:
  - **Judiciary** (Supreme Court, High Courts, District Courts) resolves **disputes** (e.g., **Mandal case**), protects **rights**, and checks **government** actions.
  - **Supreme Court** (highest, integrated with all courts) uses **judicial review** to strike down unconstitutional **laws** or actions.
  - Independence: Judges appointed by **President** with Chief Justice input, removable only by **Parliament** impeachment (never happened), not controlled by **executive** or **legislature**.
  - **Public Interest Litigation** lets citizens challenge **government** misuse, enhancing trust in **judiciary** as a rights guardian.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - **Legislature** (**Parliament**) makes **laws**, **Executive** (**Prime Minister**, **Cabinet**) executes them, **Judiciary** (**Supreme Court**) resolves **disputes**.
  - **Institutions** connect: **Parliament** controls **Executive**, **President** links both, **Judiciary** checks all, ensuring **democratic** balance.
  - Rules and delays in **institutions** slow decisions but protect fairness and accountability in **democracy**.
