### 2. Summary in Bullet Points

Here is a detailed summary of the chapter with important words bolded:

- **Overview**:
  - **Democracy** needs **elections** and **institutions**, but also **rights** to be complete; **rights** limit rulers’ power.
  - This chapter explores life without **rights**, defines **rights**, lists India’s **Fundamental Rights**, and shows how they’re enforced and expanding.

- **Section 5.1 - Life Without Rights**:
  - **Guantanamo Bay**: 600 people secretly jailed by the US, no trials, tortured despite US laws; UN called for closure, US refused.
  - **Saudi Arabia**: Hereditary king rules, no **voting**, no political parties, restricted religion and women’s **rights**.
  - **Kosovo**: Elected leader Milosevic ordered ethnic massacre of Albanians (e.g., Batisha’s husband killed, house burned) in 1999; stopped by international intervention.
  - These show lack of **freedom**, **justice**, and protection, highlighting why **rights** matter.

- **Section 5.2 - Rights in a Democracy**:
  - **Rights**: Reasonable **claims** recognized by society and enforced by **law**; they balance individual needs with others’ **rights**.
  - Why needed: **Rights** sustain **democracy** by ensuring **voting** and participation, and protect **minorities** from **oppression** by majorities or **governments**.
  - Without enforcement, **rights** are just moral ideas; **violations** need courts to fix.

- **Section 5.3 - Rights in the Indian Constitution**:

- **Section 5.4 - Expanding Scope of Rights**:
  - Beyond **Fundamental Rights**, **Constitution** offers other **rights** (e.g., property, **vote**); courts expand **rights** (e.g., education, information, food from life).
  - **Human Rights**: Universal claims (e.g., work, health) push **governments**; South Africa’s **Constitution** adds privacy, housing, healthcare.
  - New **rights** evolve with struggles, societal growth, and new **constitutions**, showing **rights** aren’t static.

- **National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)**:
  - Set up in 1993, independent of **government**, investigates **rights violations**, recommends action, but can’t punish (courts do).
