### Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of "If I Were You"

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the play "If I Were You" by Douglas James, based on the provided text and additional insights. It aims to cover all relevant details for a thorough understanding, suitable for educational purposes or deeper literary study.

#### Characters and Setting

The play features two main characters:

- **Vincent Charles Gerrard:** A playwright living alone in a cottage in the wilds of Essex. He is described as cultured, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, and owning a car parked in the garage nearby. His profession as a playwright is evident from his mention of "props" and "rehearsal" at the end, suggesting a creative and quick-witted personality.
- **Intruder:** A criminal wanted for murder and jewel robbery, similar in build to Gerrard. His plan is to kill Gerrard and assume his identity to evade the police, leveraging their physical resemblance and Gerrard's reclusive lifestyle.

The setting is a small cottage interior, simply furnished with a table, chairs, a divan, and a telephone, creating an intimate and isolated atmosphere that heightens the tension of the intruder’s threat.

#### Plot Summary and Key Events

The play opens with Gerrard making a phone call, saying, "tell him to phone up directly. I must know... Yes, I expect I'll still be here, but you mustn't count on that. In about ten minutes' time. Right-ho. Goodbye." This establishes his expectation to leave soon, setting the stage for the intruder’s interruption. As he packs his bag, the intruder enters silently with a revolver, accidentally bumping against the table, which alerts Gerrard.

The intruder immediately threatens Gerrard, saying, "Put those paws up!" and reveals his intention to kill him and take his identity. The dialogue reveals the intruder’s background: he is a jewel robber who has killed a policeman and is on the run, stating, "I'm wanted for murder already, and they can't hang me twice." He believes he can pass as Gerrard by wearing glasses, noting, "I've only got to wear specs and I'll be enough like you to get away with it."

Gerrard, however, remains calm and uses his wit to delay the intruder. He engages him in conversation, asking questions like, "Are you American, or is that merely a clever imitation?" and making sarcastic remarks, such as, "This is all very melodramatic, not very original, perhaps, but..." The intruder, frustrated, demands answers, asking if Gerrard lives alone and if he has a car, to which Gerrard eventually admits, "I do possess a car, and it's in the garage round the corner."

The turning point comes when Gerrard, realizing the danger, decides to deceive the intruder. He claims, "This is your big surprise. I said you wouldn't kill me and I was right. Why do you think I am here today and gone tomorrow, never see tradespeople? You say my habits would suit you. You are a crook. Do you think I am a Sunday-school teacher?" He further elaborates, "The game's up as far as I'm concerned. Things went wrong with me. I said it with bullets and got away. Unfortunately, they got one of my men, and found things the fool should have burnt. Tonight I'm expecting trouble. My bag's packed ready to clear off. There it is," showing a bag with a disguise outfit to convince the intruder.

The intruder, confused and believing Gerrard, agrees to go with him, saying, "May be you're right. Then don't waste time." At this moment, a telephone bell rings, and Gerrard feigns urgency, saying, "Come on! They're after us. Through here straight to the garage." When the intruder turns to look, Gerrard pushes him into a cupboard, knocks the revolver out of his hand, and locks him in. The intruder shouts, "Let me out of here!" but Gerrard, now in control, calls the police, saying, "Sorry I can't let you have the props in time for rehearsal, I've had a spot of bother— quite amusing. I think I'll put it in my next play. Listen, can you tell our friend the Sergeant to come up here at once? You'll probably find him in the Public Bar."

#### Thematic Analysis

The play explores several themes:

- **Identity and Deception:** The intruder’s plan to assume Gerrard’s identity highlights the theme of identity theft, while Gerrard’s deception—pretending to be a criminal—underscores the power of quick thinking in preserving one’s identity.
- **Wit and Presence of Mind:** Gerrard’s ability to remain calm and craft a convincing lie demonstrates how mental agility can overcome physical threats, a key message for students studying the play.
- **Crime and Punishment:** The intruder’s criminal background contrasts with Gerrard’s innocent, creative profession, reinforcing the moral that crime does not pay, as the intruder is ultimately caught.

#### Detailed Interactions and Dialogue

The dialogue is rich with tension and irony. For instance, Gerrard’s line, "At last a sympathetic audience! I'll tell you the story of my life," is sarcastic, given the intruder’s hostile intent. The intruder’s frustration is evident in lines like, "You'll soon stop being smart. I'll make you crawl," showing his aggressive approach. Gerrard’s cultured voice and the intruder’s attempt to imitate it, saying, "This is Mr V.C. Gerrard speaking," in a pantomime, highlight the identity theme.
