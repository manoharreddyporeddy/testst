**3. Examples and Applications**

- **Rectangle Angles:**
  - Given a rectangle with one 90° angle, prove all angles are 90° using co-interior angles.
- **Rhombus Diagonals:**
  - Prove diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular using SSS congruence and linear pairs.
  - Prove diagonals are perpendicular using SSS congruence, e.g., show $$\triangle ABC \cong \triangle ADC$$
- **Parallelogram angle bisectors:**
  - The angle bisectors of a parallelogram form a rectangle.
- **Parallel Line Transversal Application:**
  - Bisectors of interior angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal create a rectangle.
