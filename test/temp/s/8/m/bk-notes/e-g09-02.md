3.  **Complete Summary with Full Details**

This part of the chapter tells the inspiring story of **Evelyn Glennie**, a Scottish girl who pursued her dream of music despite a major challenge.

The story begins with a seventeen-year-old **Evelyn** feeling nervous but excited on her way to the prestigious **Royal Academy of Music** in **London**. This was a huge achievement for anyone, especially for someone from a Scottish farm, but **Evelyn** faced a bigger, more **daunting** challenge: she was **profoundly deaf**.

**Evelyn's** hearing loss wasn't sudden. Her mother first noticed something was wrong when **Evelyn**, at eight years old, didn't respond to her name being called. For a while, **Evelyn** hid her growing deafness. By the time she was eleven, her school performance worsened, and her headmistress advised her parents to consult a specialist. It was discovered that her hearing was severely **impaired** due to gradual nerve damage. She was advised to use hearing aids and attend a school for the deaf.

However, **Evelyn** was **determined** to lead a normal life and was passionate about **music**. Though discouraged by most teachers, her **potential** was recognized by **percussionist Ron Forbes**. He guided her, not to listen through her ears, but to **sense music** in other ways. He used two large drums, tuned to different notes, and told her to feel the higher drum's vibrations in the upper part of her body and the lower drum's in the lower part. **Evelyn** realized she could feel these **vibrations**, and this was the turning point. Through sheer **determination** and hard work, she learned to open her mind and body to sound and **vibrations**.

From then on, **Evelyn** never looked back. She toured the United Kingdom with a youth orchestra. At sixteen, she **auditioned** for the **Royal Academy of Music** and achieved one of the highest scores in its history. She gradually moved from orchestral work to becoming a highly successful **solo performer**.

**Evelyn** doesn't consider her achievement heroic; she believes if you work hard and know your goal, you will reach it. She became the world's most sought-after **multi-percussionist**, mastering thousands of instruments. It's **intriguing** to watch her, as she "listens" to music so effortlessly. She explains that she reads lips, but also observes the whole face, especially the eyes, to understand speech, speaking **flawlessly** with a Scottish accent.

When asked how she senses music, **Evelyn** explains that music "pours in through every part of my body." It **tingles** in her skin, her cheekbones, and her hair. When she plays the **xylophone**, she feels the sound vibrations passing up the sticks into her fingertips. Leaning against the drums, she feels the **resonances**. She often performs **barefoot** on wooden platforms to feel the **vibrations** pass through her feet and up her legs.

**Evelyn Glennie** delights her audiences. In 1991, she received the Royal Philharmonic Society’s prestigious Soloist of the Year Award. Master percussionist James Blades remarked that she feels music more deeply than many who can hear. **Evelyn** is a self-confessed **workaholic** who, besides her regular concerts, gives free performances in prisons and hospitals and gives classes to young musicians. Ann Richlin of the Beethoven Fund for Deaf Children calls her a **shining inspiration** for deaf children, showing them that there are no limits to what they can achieve. **Evelyn Glennie** has accomplished more than most people twice her age, brought percussion to the forefront of the orchestra, and given **enormous** pleasure to millions, inspiring many, especially those with disabilities, with her life story.

**3. Complete Summary**

**Evelyn Glennie's** story begins on a crowded train platform in London. She's a **slight**, young **Scottish** girl, excited but nervous about her first day at the **prestigious Royal Academy of Music**. However, Evelyn faces a unique challenge: she is **profoundly deaf**.

Her **hearing loss** was **gradual**. Her mother noticed something was wrong when Evelyn, at age eight, didn't respond when her name was called. For a while, Evelyn tried to **conceal** her growing deafness, but by age eleven, her marks had **deteriorated**, and a **specialist** confirmed severe **nerve damage**.

Despite being advised to wear hearing aids and attend a school for the deaf, Evelyn was **determined** to lead a **normal** life and **pursue** her passion for music. She saw a girl playing the **xylophone** and wanted to play it too. While most teachers **discouraged** her, **percussionist Ron Forbes** saw her **potential**.

Forbes began by **tuning** two large drums to different notes. He told Evelyn not to listen through her ears but to try and **sense** the music in another way. Evelyn realized she could feel the higher drum from the **waist** up and the lower one from the waist down. Forbes repeated this **exercise**, and Evelyn discovered she could feel **certain** notes in different parts of her body. Her mind and body opened to sounds and vibrations, through **sheer determination** and hard work.

Evelyn's career took off. She toured the United Kingdom with a youth **orchestra** and **auditioned** for the Royal Academy of Music, scoring one of the highest marks in its history. She moved from **orchestral** work to solo performances and **captured** many top awards.

It's **intriguing** to watch Evelyn perform so **flawlessly** without hearing. She explains that she can understand speech by watching people's faces, not just their lips, and that her Scottish **lilt** is clear because she learned to speak before losing her hearing.
For music, she feels how "it pours in through every part of my body". The vibrations **tingle** in her skin, and she senses the **resonances** flowing into her.

Evelyn **delights** her audiences and received the Royal Philharmonic Society's **prestigious** Soloist of the Year Award.

---

**3. Complete Summary (Easy-to-Understand)**

In this part of the chapter, we learn about the **shehnai**, a wind instrument that replaced the **pungi** once it was **banned** for being too shrill in the **royal** court.

**3. Complete Summary with Full Details**

This chapter tells the story of the legendary **shehnai maestro**, **Ustad Bismillah Khan**, and the instrument itself.

The **shehnai** originated as an improvement over the **pungi**, a **reeded instrument** with a **shrill**, unpleasant sound banned by Emperor **Aurangzeb**. A **barber** from a family of **professional musicians**, with access to the **royal residence**, decided to improve its **tonal quality**. He used a pipe with a natural **hollow stem**, longer and broader than the pungi, and made seven holes. When played, it produced **soft and melodious sounds**. Since it was first played in the **Shah's** chambers by a **nai** (barber), it was named **'shehnai'**.

The sound of the **shehnai** came to be considered **auspicious** (bringing good fortune). As a result, it became an **indispensable** part of ceremonies in **temples** and **North Indian weddings**. Traditionally, it was part of the **naubat**, a court **ensemble** of nine instruments. **Ustad Bismillah Khan** is credited with bringing this instrument from **temples** and weddings onto the **classical stage**.

**Bismillah Khan** was born on 21 March 1916 in **Dumraon, Bihar**, into a well-known family of **musicians**. His grandfather, Rasool Bux Khan, was the shehnai-nawaz of the Bhojpur king's court. His father and other **paternal ancestors** were also great **shehnai** players. As a five-year-old, he played **gilli-danda** and would **regularly** sing the Bhojpuri 'Chaita' at the local **Bihariji temple**, earning a large laddu as a prize.

At age three, he moved to his **maternal uncle's** house in **Benaras** (now Varanasi). He was **fascinated** watching his uncle, **Ali Bux**, practise the **shehnai**. Ali Bux was **employed** to play at the **Vishwanath temple**. Bismillah started **accompanying** him and would sit **captivated** for hours. He soon became Ali Bux's **apprentice**, practising throughout the day. The flowing **Ganga river** and the **temples** of Balaji and Mangala Maiya became his favourite spots to practise in **solitude**. The river's waters **inspired** him to **improvise** and invent new **ragas**.

At 14, he **accompanied** his uncle to the Allahabad Music Conference. After his **recital**, the great **Ustad Faiyaz Khan** encouraged him, saying, "Work hard and you shall make it." His **big break** came with the opening of **All India Radio** in Lucknow in 1938; he soon became an often-heard **shehnai** player on radio.

When **India** gained **independence** on 15 August 1947, **Bismillah Khan** became the first Indian to **greet** the **nation** with his **shehnai** from the Red Fort. He played Raag Kafi before Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru gave his famous 'Tryst with Destiny' speech.

**Bismillah Khan** gave many **memorable** performances in India and **abroad**. His first trip **abroad** was to Afghanistan, where King Zahir Shah was so **impressed** that he gifted him Persian carpets and other **souvenirs**. Film director **Vijay Bhatt**, after hearing him at a **festival**, named a film **"Gunj Uthi Shehnai"**. One of Khan's **compositions** in the film, "Dil ka khilona hai toot gaya," became a nationwide **chartbuster**. He also worked on a Kannada film. However, he found the **artificiality** and **glamour** of the **celluloid world** unappealing and limited his film involvement, stating with **emphasis** his dislike for it.

Awards and **recognition** followed. He was the first Indian invited to perform at the **prestigious** Lincoln Center Hall in the USA. He also performed at the World Exposition in Montreal, the Cannes Art Festival, and the Osaka Trade Fair. An **auditorium** in Teheran was named after him. He received India's top **national awards** – the Padmashri, Padma Bhushan, and Padma Vibhushan. In 2001, the **coveted Bharat Ratna**, India's highest **civilian award**, was **conferred** upon him. With eyes **glinting** with happiness, he urged Indians to teach their children music, highlighting India's rich tradition.

Despite international fame, **Ustad Bismillah Khan** remained deeply attached to his roots. He fondly called **Benaras** and **Dumraon** the most wonderful towns in the world. He had a profound connection to the **holy Ganga river**. A student once offered to set up a shehnai school in the USA and replicate the atmosphere of Benaras, but Khan asked if he could transport the River Ganga as well. He expressed his deep **yearning** for **Hindustan** when **abroad**, and specifically for **Benaras** and the **Ganga** when in Mumbai, missing the unique 'mattha' (buttermilk) of **Dumraon**.

**Ustad Bismillah Khan passed away** on 21 August 2006, at the age of 90, after a **prolonged illness**. He was given a **state funeral**, and the government declared a day of **national mourning**. His life exemplifies India's rich **cultural heritage** and secular fabric – a **devout** Muslim who naturally played the **shehnai** every morning at the Hindu **Kashi Vishwanath temple** in Benaras.

Wind, come softly.
Don’t break the shutters of the windows.
Don’t scatter the papers.
Don’t throw down the books on the shelf.
There, look what you did — you threw them all down.
You tore the pages of the books.
You brought rain again.
You’re very clever at poking fun at weaklings.
Frail crumbling houses, crumbling doors, crumbling rafters,
crumbling wood, crumbling bodies, crumbling lives,
crumbling hearts —
the wind god winnows and crushes them all.
He won’t do what you tell him.
So, come, let’s build strong homes,
Let’s join the doors firmly.
Practise to firm the body.
Make the heart steadfast.
Do this, and the wind will be friends with us.
The wind blows out weak fires.
He makes strong fires roar and flourish.
His friendship is good.
We praise him every day.
```
