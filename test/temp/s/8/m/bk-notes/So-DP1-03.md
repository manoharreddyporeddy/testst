### 2. Summary in Bullet Points

Here is a detailed summary of the chapter with important words bolded:

- **Overview**:
  - In a **democracy**, people rule through **representatives** elected in **elections**, not directly.
  - This chapter explains why **elections** are needed, how **electoral competition** helps, and what makes **elections democratic**.
  - It examines India’s **election system**, its stages, and whether it’s **free and fair**, focusing on the **Election Commission’s** role.

- **Section 3.1 - Why Elections?**:
  - Example: In 1987 Haryana **Assembly election**, **Devi Lal’s** Lok Dal won 60 of 90 seats with a promise to waive loans, beating Congress (5 seats).
  - **Elections** are needed because direct rule by all isn’t possible in large groups; **representatives** are chosen instead.
  - **Elections** let **voters** pick lawmakers, **government** leaders, and **policies**, and change them if unhappy.
  - **Democratic elections** need: equal **voting rights** (one person, one **vote**), real choices, regular intervals, people’s preferred **candidate** winning, and **free and fair** process.
  - **Competition** in **elections** has flaws (disunity, dirty tricks) but pushes parties to serve people to win, like a market rewards good service.

- **Section 3.2 - What is Our System of Elections?**:
  - **General elections** happen every 5 years for Lok Sabha (543 seats) and Vidhan Sabha; **by-elections** fill single vacancies.
  - **Constituencies**: India uses area-based representation; each **constituency** elects one **MP** or **MLA** with equal population sizes.
  - **Reserved Constituencies**: 84 seats for Scheduled Castes (SC), 47 for Scheduled Tribes (ST) in Lok Sabha; also for OBCs and women (1/3rd) in local bodies (per 2023 Women’s Reservation Act).
  - **Voters’ List**: All citizens 18+ can **vote** (universal adult **franchise**); updated regularly with Election Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) optional.
  - **Nomination**: Anyone 25+ can be a **candidate**, filing a **nomination** with details on crimes, assets, and education made public.
  - **Campaign**: Two-week period for parties to push issues (e.g., “Garibi Hatao” 1971, “Save Democracy” 1977); regulated to ban bribes, caste/religion appeals, and overspending (₹25 lakh Lok Sabha, ₹10 lakh Assembly).
  - **Polling and Counting**: **Voters** use Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) on election day; votes counted with party agents present; highest vote-getter wins (e.g., Gulbarga 2014: Kharge won with 50.82%).

- **Section 3.3 - What Makes Elections in India Democratic?**:
  - **Independent Election Commission (EC)**: Led by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC), appointed by the President but not removable by **government**; controls all election aspects, enforces **Code of Conduct**, orders repolls.
  - **Unfair Practices**: Fake **voters’ list** names, **government** misuse, money power, and **rigging** occur but don’t usually overturn **election** outcomes.
  - **Popular Participation**: **Voter turnout** (e.g., 66% in 2015) is high, especially among poor and underprivileged, unlike declining turnout in the West; 67% feel their **vote** matters.
  - **Acceptance of Outcome**: Ruling parties lose often (2/3 times in 25 years); **incumbents** lose half the time; results are accepted as people’s **verdict**.
  - **Challenges**: Money and criminal candidates give unfair advantages; family dominance in parties limits choice; small parties struggle against big ones.
  - **Conclusion**: India’s **elections** are mostly **free and fair**, reflecting people’s will, but reforms are needed for deeper issues like money power and real choice.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - **Elections** are essential for **democracy**, letting **voters** choose and change leaders via **competition**.
  - India’s system ensures equal **voting**, reserved seats, and an independent **EC**, making it largely **democratic**.
  - High **participation** and accepted **verdicts** show strength, but money, crime, and limited options are challenges.
