### Santosh Yadav: A Mountaineering Pioneer

Santosh Yadav, born in Joniyawas, Rewari District, Haryana, broke barriers in mountaineering. From a family with five sons, she was named "Santosh," meaning content, but she defied traditional roles, preferring shorts over traditional dresses. At 16, she resisted marriage, pursued education in Delhi, and convinced her parents to fund her studies after threatening to work part-time. She later studied at Maharani College in Jaipur, discovered mountaineering from her hostel, and trained at Uttarkashi's institute. In 1992, at age 20, she became the youngest woman to climb Mount Everest, showing concern for teammates, and climbed it again in 1993, a unique feat. She earned the Padmashri award and brought down 500 kg of garbage from the Himalayas, highlighting her environmental efforts.

### Maria Sharapova: Tennis Star with Russian Roots

Maria Sharapova, born in Siberia, Russia, moved to the US at age 9 for tennis training, leaving her mother behind due to visa issues, facing loneliness that built her mental toughness. She won Wimbledon in 2004 and became world number one in 2005 at 18, driven by a competitive spirit and monetary motivation. Despite her American accent, she proudly identifies as Russian, planning to play for Russia in the Olympics. Her hobbies include fashion, singing, dancing, and reading Arthur Conan Doyle, with a fondness for pancakes and fizzy drinks, adding a personal touch to her public image.

### Poems: Insights into Nature

The poem "On Killing a Tree" by Gieve Patel emphasizes that killing a tree isn't easyâ€”it requires more than cutting; one must uproot it and let it dry in the sun, exposing its roots. In contrast, "Trees" by Joyce Kilmer celebrates their beauty, likening them to poetry, describing them as feeding from the earth, hosting birds, and connecting with nature, asserting only God can create such wonders.

#### Biographical Insights: Santosh Yadav and Maria Sharapova

**Santosh Yadav's Journey:**
Santosh Yadav, born in Joniyawas, Rewari District, Haryana, was the sixth child in a family with five sons, named "Santosh," meaning content. However, she was far from content with traditional roles, preferring shorts over traditional Indian dresses, reflecting her early determination. At 16, when village girls typically married, she resisted, threatening her parents against marriage without education, and moved to Delhi. Her parents, affluent landowners, initially sent her to the local school per custom but agreed to fund her Delhi education after her resolve to work part-time if needed. She later joined Maharani College in Jaipur, where, from Kasturba Hostel, she observed villagers climbing hills, sparking her interest in mountaineering. She enrolled in Uttarkashi's Nehru Institute of Mountaineering, writing a letter of apology to her father for doing so without permission. In 1992, at age 20, she became the youngest woman to climb Mount Everest, impressing seniors with her skills and endearing herself to teammates through acts like trying to save a dying climber and sharing oxygen with Mohan Singh. She climbed Everest again in 1993, setting a record as the only woman to do so twice, earning the Padmashri award. As a fervent environmentalist, she collected and brought down 500 kg of garbage from the Himalayas, describing her summit feelings as indescribable, unfurling the Indian flag with pride.

**Maria Sharapova's Ascent:**
Maria Sharapova, born in Siberia, Russia, began her tennis journey at age 9, moving to the United States for training, a decision that meant a heart-wrenching two-year separation from her mother due to visa issues, with her father, Yuri, supporting her financially. She faced loneliness, with other pupils waking her at 11 p.m. to clean, yet this hardship fueled her determination. She became mentally tough, never considering quitting, driven by her dream. Her rapid rise led to winning Wimbledon in 2004 and becoming world number one on 22 August 2005 at age 18, a meteoric ascent in a competitive field. Despite her American accent, she proudly identifies as Russian, planning to play for Russia in the Olympics, stating, "My blood is totally Russian." Her hobbies include fashion, singing, dancing, and reading Arthur Conan Doyle, with a love for pancakes with chocolate spread and fizzy orange drinks, adding a personal layer to her glamorous image. Her mantra for success is competitiveness and hard work, viewing tennis as both a business and sport, motivated by becoming number one and monetary gains.

#### Poetic Reflections: Nature's Resilience and Beauty

**On Killing a Tree by Gieve Patel:**
This poem explores the difficulty of killing a tree, asserting it takes more than a "simple jab of the knife." Trees grow slowly, consuming earth, absorbing sunlight, air, and water, with bark described as "leprous hide" sprouting leaves. Hacking and chopping won't suffice; the bleeding bark heals, and new twigs rise, expanding if unchecked. To kill, one must pull out the root from the "anchoring earth," rope and snap it out, exposing the "source, white and wet," hidden for years. Then, scorching and choking in sun and air, browning, hardening, twisting, withering, finally kills the tree, emphasizing its resilience and the effort required for destruction.

**Trees by Joyce Kilmer:**
Joyce Kilmer's poem celebrates trees' beauty, stating, "I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree." Trees are personified with a "hungry mouth" pressed against the earth's "sweet flowing breast," looking at God all day, lifting "leafy arms to pray." They wear nests of robins in summer, have snow lain on their bosom, and live intimately with rain. The poem concludes, "Poems are made by fools like me, / But only God can make a tree," highlighting their divine creation and natural splendor, contrasting human poetry with nature's perfection.
