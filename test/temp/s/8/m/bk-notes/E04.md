### Notes for the Teacher

- **Purpose of the Story**: Highlights Einstein as an ordinary human with likes, dislikes, rebellious streaks, and problems, prompting students to consider what qualities define a genius or great person.
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**: Suggests collaborating with a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory of Relativity and foster inter-subject cooperation.
- **Exercise Guidance**: Matching headings to paragraphs helps students identify topic sentences or scan for specific information; students can suggest alternative headings.
- **Writing a Newspaper Report**: Students should learn to write concise, eye-catching reports with a headline, reporter’s name, place, date, source, and structured paragraphs (beginning expands headline, middle provides details, conclusion sums up).
  - Use passives for past actions (e.g., "has been unearthed") and present tense for statements (e.g., "The document contains...").
  - Important points may be boxed in the report.
- **Dictation Exercise**: Features an anecdote for dictation to encourage individual participation, unconscious thinking, and attention to language form, with self or peer correction opportunities.
  - Students read the passage silently first, noting punctuation, then listen to it read aloud twice with proper intonation and pauses, and check it during a third reading.

### A Truly Beautiful Mind

- **Introduction**: Explores who a genius is and qualities they possess, introducing Einstein’s groundbreaking 1905 papers on light, particle motion, electrodynamics, and energy (E = mc²), which transformed our understanding of space, time, and the cosmos.
- **Early Life**:
  - Born 14 March 1879 in Ulm, Germany; no early signs of greatness; mother thought his large head made him a "freak."
  - Late talker (spoke at two-and-a-half), repeating words; nicknamed "Brother Boring" by playmates for preferring solitary play with mechanical toys.
  - Anecdote: First words at supper, “The soup is too hot,” explaining silence as “everything was in order” until then.
- **Education**:
  - Attended high school in Munich (family moved there at 15 months); good grades but hated regimentation, clashed with teachers, left school at 15.
  - Parents moved to Milan; Einstein joined them after discussions, continued education in liberal Switzerland (Zurich University).
  - Gifted in math and physics; began violin at six, becoming a skilled amateur violinist lifelong.
- **Young Adulthood**:
  - Met Mileva Maric at Zurich University (one of few places women could earn degrees); saw her as an ally against "philistines" (family and university foes); fell in love, blending science and affection in letters.
  - Graduated 1900, unemployed; worked as teaching assistant, gave private lessons, then joined Bern patent office in 1902 as a technical expert.
  - Secretly developed ideas at work, calling his desk drawer the “bureau of theoretical physics.”
- **Scientific Breakthroughs**:
  - 1905: Published Special Theory of Relativity (time and distance not absolute; E = mc²).
  - 1915: General Theory of Relativity (new gravity interpretation), proven by 1919 solar eclipse observations; hailed as a “scientific revolution.”
  - 1921: Nobel Prize in Physics; global fame, honors, and press acclaim.
- **Personal Life**:
  - Wanted to marry Mileva post-studies; mother opposed due to Mileva’s age (three years older) and intelligence; married 1903, had two sons.
  - Marriage faltered; Mileva lost ambition, became unhappy; divorced 1919; Einstein married cousin Elsa same year.
- **Later Life and Politics**:
  - 1933: Emigrated to U.S. as Nazis rose in Germany.
  - 1939: Warned President Roosevelt about atomic bomb potential after nuclear fission discovery; influenced U.S. to develop it, used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945).
  - Shaken by destruction, proposed world government to UN (no impact); campaigned for peace, democracy, and against arms buildup.
  - Died 1955 at 76, celebrated as a visionary, world citizen, and scientific genius.
