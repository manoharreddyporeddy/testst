You're absolutely right. My previous response was too broad and didn't focus enough on the specific content and structure of the CBSE Grade 9 Chapter 7 "Triangles" as presented in your provided text. Let's create a response that adheres closely to the structure and concepts found in your provided chapter excerpt.

**Grade 9 Chapter 7 (CBSE) - Triangles (Focused and Precise)**

**7.1 Introduction**

- A triangle is a closed figure formed by three intersecting lines.
- A triangle has three sides, three angles, and three vertices.
- Example: ∆ABC has sides AB, BC, CA; angles ∠A, ∠B, ∠C; and vertices A, B, C.
- This chapter focuses on congruence of triangles, rules of congruence, properties of triangles, and inequalities in a triangle.

**7.2 Congruence of Triangles**

- Congruent figures are equal in all respects (same shape and size).
- Examples of congruent figures:
  - Two copies of a photograph of the same size.
  - Two bangles of the same size.
  - Two ATM cards from the same bank.
  - Two one-rupee coins minted in the same year.
  - Two circles of the same radius.
  - Two squares of the same side length.
  - Two equilateral triangles of equal side length.
- Two triangles are congruent if the sides and angles of one triangle are equal to the corresponding sides and angles of the other triangle.
- Notation: ∆PQR ≅ ∆ABC means triangle PQR is congruent to triangle ABC.
- When ∆PQR ≅ ∆ABC, then:
  - PQ covers AB, QR covers BC, RP covers CA.
  - ∠P covers ∠A, ∠Q covers ∠B, ∠R covers ∠C.
  - Correspondence: P ↔ A, Q ↔ B, R ↔ C.
- CPCT: Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles (corresponding parts are equal).

**7.3 Criteria for Congruence of Triangles**

- **SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Congruence Rule (Axiom 7.1):**
  - Two triangles are congruent if two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the two sides and the included angle of the other triangle.
- **Theorem 7.1 (ASA Congruence Rule):**
  - Two triangles are congruent if two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of the other triangle.
  - Proof: Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, covering all possible length combinations.
- **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) Congruence Rule:**
  - If two angles and one non included side are equal, then the triangles are congruent.
- Equality of three angles is not sufficient for congruence.
- **Theorem 7.4 (SSS Congruence Rule):**
  - If three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.
- **Theorem 7.5 (RHS Congruence Rule):**
  - If in two right triangles, the hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle, then the two triangles are congruent.

**7.4 Some Properties of a Triangle**

- **Isosceles Triangle:** A triangle in which two sides are equal.
- **Theorem 7.2:** Angles opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal.
- **Theorem 7.3:** The sides opposite to equal angles of a triangle are equal (converse of Theorem 7.2).

**7.5 Some More Criteria for Congruence of Triangles**

- Covered already in section 7.3.

**7.6 Summary**

- Congruent figures: same shape and size.
- Congruent circles: same radii.
- Congruent squares: same sides.
- Notation for congruent triangles.
- SAS, ASA, AAS, SSS, RHS congruence rules.
- Angles opposite equal sides are equal.
- Sides opposite equal angles are equal.
- Angles of an equilateral triangle are 60°.

**Key Points from the Text:**

- Emphasis on visual activities and hands-on verification.
- Clear distinction between axioms and theorems.
- Importance of correct correspondence when writing congruence statements.
- Focus on proving congruence using the stated rules.
- Use of CPCT.
